i want to upgrade this AI model to become a website using Figma Make and replit. Help me guide how to do this. Here is github link for my AI model "https://github.com/ellynnhitran/credit-card-fraud-detection-xgboost" here is description of it "credit-card-fraud-detection-xgboost Project Overview This project aims to develop a robust and accurate credit card fraud detection system using XGBoost. The dataset used in this project contains transactional data, with features that describe the transactions and labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent. Dataset The Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset is from Kaggle Challenge. This is divided into two main files: Training Data: fraudTrain3.csv Testing Data: fraudTest3.csv Key Features: merchant: Merchant name category: Transaction category amount: Transaction amount cc_num: Credit card number first, last: Cardholder's first and last name gender: Cardholder's gender street, city, state, zip: Cardholder's address lat, long: Cardholder's latitude and longitude city_pop: Population of the city job: Cardholder's job dob: Cardholder's date of birth trans_num: Transaction number unix_time: Transaction time in Unix format merch_lat, merch_long: Merchant's latitude and longitude is_fraud: Label indicating if the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0) Steps to reproduce Import Libraries: The project begins by importing essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. Data Collection: Collect Data: The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes simulated credit card transactions from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020. It consists of records from 1,000 customers and 800 merchants, providing a rich diversity of data points for analysis. Clean Data: Checking and handling missing values ensures data integrity. Feature Engineering: New feature was created to capture patterns that might indicate fraud. hour_of_day were created by converting 'unix_time' to 'transaction_time' and extract 'hour_of_day' to understand temporal patterns. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is conducted to uncover patterns and inform feature engineering. Model Training: Incorporating EDA Insights into Model Training Train-Test Split: Divide the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Handling Imbalance: Utilize SMOTE to address class imbalance. Model Evaluation: Initial evaluation of the model's performance is conducted using classification reports and confusion matrices. Model Optimization and Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning is performed using RandomizedSearchCV to enhance model performance. Tuned Model Evaluation: The performance of the tuned model is re-evaluated to assess improvements." help me think of different ideas to make use of this AI model to become website useful
